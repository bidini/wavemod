## Some instructions

WaveMod calculates synthetic waveforms using various tools. Three main classes are currently available:
- WaveDB deals with synthetic waveforms computed from Green's function database
- WaveInt is a wrapper of Bob Hermann's Wavenumber Integration code
- FastSweep is a simple 2D eikonal solver used for rupture front propagation on simple faults

- The WaveMod module must be located in a directory that is incuded in the PYTHONPATH environment.

- To use WaveDB, GFs databases must be organized following the W-phase format. We use SAC files stored in sub-directories as follows:
   H????.?/??/GF.????.SY.LH?.SAC
where 
   - H????.?: depth
   - ??: moment tensor component (PP,RP,RR,RT,TP,TT)
   - ????: epicentral distance x 10 (in km or deg)
   - LH?: component (either LHL or LHZ)  

- To WaveInt, the package "Computer programs in seismology" must be installed and path to associated binaries must be included in the PATH environment variable.
